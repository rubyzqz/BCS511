# 10/20/21 class assignment: work through RStudio Cloud Primer 2 and Primer 4 on data wrangling. Go through an initial clean-up/formatting of the variables (e.g., reformatting variable types; renaming variables; removing unnecessary variables) [see also dplyr introduction with links to more advanced vignettes; cheat sheet], try to tabulate or visualize one aspect of your data. Push new code to repository, and alert collaborators (incl. instructor).

##dataset: us_contagious_diseases

##variables:
- disease. A factor containing disease names.
- state. A factor containing state names.
- year.
- weeks_reporting. Number of weeks counts were reported that year.
- count. Total number of reported cases.
- population. State population, interpolated for non-census years.

#install.packages("dslabs")
library(tidyverse)

# Which state has the most Hepatitis A cases?
us_contagious_diseases %>%
  filter(disease == "Hepatitis A") %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count), cases_per_year = mean(count)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))


# plot Hepatitis A cases in NY and KS over the years
us_contagious_diseases %>%
    filter(disease == "Hepatitis A",state == "New York" | state == "Kansas") %>%
    select(year, count, state) %>%
